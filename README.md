[Covid-19 Prediction Application Link - Hosted on Heroku](https://covidappproject.herokuapp.com/)

###### Description:
This application was built with the streamlit framework, using the Python language as the core building block. The pandas package was used in Jupyter Notebook for the majority of the data cleaning|processing and the sci-kit learn and scipy packages were used for building the machine learning element used for the supervised learning application. Logistic Regression and Ridge Regression was the model and argument, which achieved an 89% accuracy score. Pickle was also used for the encoding process of the application.

Using the different parameters, the application will predict the death probability and surviving probability based on the socio-economic traits selected. The application also further explains the power of Ridge Regression and it's use to achieve the strong accuracy score. The code for this application can be found in the covid_prediction_application folder.

###### Description:
This report was created using the Google Maps API, which pulls competitor data into a custom Excel-based dashboard. This was distributed on a regional level to assist the franchisee group with maximum shaping of their pricing tiers. The decision to use an Excel dashboard report was to maximize useability within our whole franchisee group.
